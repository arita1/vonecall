Instead we only display the last four digits of the card number for your security. No customer service reps at PinlessWorld have access to your credit card information.

              <p>Pinless dialing is the ability to conveniently make calls without ever entering a pin number. It's faster than direct dialing and saves you over 80% on long distances! With pinless dialing you don't have to remember your PIN on every call. </p>

              <p>Can I register my Mobile Phone for Pinless Dialing?</p>
              <p>You can use your plan from your cell phone in the same way you use it from your home phone. You will benefit from up to 80% lower rates than your regular cellular provider. You do not have to cancel your international dialing on your cellular phone but when you dial international number using our service, please DO NOT press SEND button again on your cellular phone instead press # sign at the end of destination number entry. ALERT: If you push "SEND" button at the end of destination number while using a prepaid calling service with your cell phone, you may automatically activate the 3-way calling feature from your cell phone. If your second line is activated by mistake, that second line will be billed AT THE FULL BILLING RATE from your cell phone carrier. So please be careful and follow our instructions carefully and you will not have any issues or get any massive overage charges from your cell phone carrier. If at anytime you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email us.</p>

              <h5>Here are a few troubleshooting tips,</h5>
              <p><strong>1) </strong> Make sure that you have successfully added Pinless Dialing to your PIN by going to your PIN manager. If you can not register your phone number, it means that your phone number is registered to a different PIN. In order to add Pinless dialing in this case, you will need to first delete your phone number from the other PIN and then add it to the new PIN. You will know that your number is registered because it will be displayed under the pinless dialing link in your PIN manager.</p>
              <p><strong>2) </strong> Make sure that you are dialing the right access number that is assigned to your current plan. It is very important that you use the right access number assigned to your plan. If you are using a access number from a different plan then you will not be able to make calls. If you are not sure which access number to use, please contact customer service for further assistance.</p>
              <p><strong>3) </strong> If you have more then one registered phone number for pinless dialing, please make sure you have not reached the simultaneous limit. In most cases only one call can be made from each account at a time, so if another one of your registered phone numbers is making a call, then you will need to wait until they get off the phone to make your call.</p>
              <p><strong>4) </strong>
              If making calls from a blocked number, Pinless Dialing will not work. In order to make calls from a blocked number, you will need to dial *82 and the access number. *82 unblocks your number for that call only and will allow our system to recognize your number and let you make pinless calls.
              </p>
              <h5>Referring Friends and Redeeming Points Earned</h5>
              <p> In order to refer your friends to PinlessWorld you must have a PinlessWorld.com Account. Once logged in, go to the home page and click on the refer a friend link. Complete the form and we will send emails to all the correspondents you entered. Once your friends get the email that we have sent them through your account they need to follow the link in the email and sign up and make a purchase. After your friend has made his first purchase you will be credited $1 and will earn 3% of all their future purchases. There is no limit in how many friends that you can have sign up.</p>
              <p> <strong> Redeem Your Points - </strong>Once you have earned money from our refer-a-friend program the money you earn will be instantly in your account but not automatically recharged into your PIN. Money earned are like credits that you can use for future purchases and recharges, the choice is your. We do not decide how to spend your points. So for example if you have earned $5 for referring your friends and you want to add the credit into your pin this is what you have to do. Login to your account and click on Pin Manager. Click on recharge and select $5. Check the box below that says use points to make purchase and click on recharge PIN. By checking the box use points, PinlessWorld is using your points to make a recharge and not your credit card. You can also use your points to get a discount on a new purchase as well. In this case for example if you recharge for $20 and click use points, we will refill your account with $20 and charge your credit card for $15.</p>
